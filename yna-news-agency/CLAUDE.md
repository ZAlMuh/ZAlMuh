### Known Issues & Solutions

#### 1. Homepage Error ("An error occurred") - ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** The homepage was showing an error because it was trying to fetch posts from an empty Supabase database.

**Solution Applied:**
- ✅ Updated error handling in HomePage.tsx to show beautiful empty state instead of error
- ✅ Updated Supabase operations to handle missing tables gracefully
- ✅ Added comprehensive empty state with welcome message in both languages

#### 2. Layout and Styling Issues - ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** The homepage layout had overwhelming gradient backgrounds and poor spacing.

**Solution Applied:**
- ✅ Fixed YNA logo SVG to be more compact and properly sized
- ✅ Improved hero section spacing and responsiveness
- ✅ Enhanced empty state with card-based design and better visual hierarchy
- ✅ Made buttons responsive with flex-wrap

**To add sample data:**
1. **Run the database schema:** Copy and run `supabase-schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor
2. **Create admin user:** Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users → Create new user
   - Email: `admin@yna.news`
   - Password: `password123`
   - Note the user ID from the dashboard
3. **Add sample posts:** 
   - Open `simple-sample-data.sql` 
   - Replace all instances of `YOUR_USER_ID_HERE` with the actual user ID from step 2
   - Copy and run the modified SQL in your Supabase SQL editor

#### 2. RTL Layout Issues - ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** Arabic RTL mode had broken navigation layout, content overflow, and improper text alignment.

**Solution Applied:**
- ✅ Added proper `dir="rtl"` and `dir="ltr"` attributes to document root in Layout component
- ✅ Replaced conditional RTL classes with Tailwind RTL variants throughout components
- ✅ Fixed Navbar spacing and alignment using `rtl:space-x-reverse` and proper RTL positioning
- ✅ Updated HomePage to use `rtl:text-right`, `rtl:flex-row-reverse` for proper Arabic layout
- ✅ Fixed YNA Logo component RTL handling with `rtl:flex-row-reverse`
- ✅ Implemented proper search bar positioning with `rtl:left-auto rtl:right-3`
- ✅ **MAJOR LAYOUT RESTRUCTURE**: Fixed broken homepage layout in RTL mode
  - ✅ Added proper container classes (`container mx-auto max-w-screen-xl px-4`) throughout
  - ✅ Moved YNA background logo to fixed positioning (`fixed top-0 left-0 -z-10`) to prevent layout interference
  - ✅ Improved responsive grid layouts for better mobile/desktop behavior
  - ✅ Enhanced RTL text alignment and button positioning with proper `rtl:justify-end` classes
  - ✅ Added proper responsive breakpoints and flexible layouts
  - ✅ Fixed newsletter form and all sections for professional media site appearance

- ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE RTL LAYOUT OVERHAUL**: Complete fix for Arabic layout issues
  - ✅ **Layout.tsx**: Restructured with proper `dir` attribute wrapper and container system
  - ✅ **HomePage.tsx**: Complete rebuild with proper RTL spacing, alignment, and typography
  - ✅ **Font Switching**: Dynamic Arabic (Noto Sans Arabic) and English (Inter) font switching
  - ✅ **Background Logo**: Fixed positioning with `fixed inset-0 -z-10 opacity-5 pointer-events-none`
  - ✅ **RTL Typography**: Added `font-arabic` class and proper `rtl:text-right` alignment
  - ✅ **Responsive Design**: Proper grid layouts with `gap-8` and mobile/desktop responsive behavior
  - ✅ **Button Alignment**: Fixed with `rtl:justify-end` and `rtl:flex-row-reverse` for Arabic
  - ✅ **Spacing System**: Enhanced padding, margins, and container constraints for clean RTL layout

#### 3. Missing Sample Data
The database is empty, so no posts are displayed. Need to either:
- Add sample posts via SQL
- Improve empty state handling
- Create admin interface to add posts

#### 4. Node.js Version Compatibility
Current Node v18.19.1 has some compatibility issues with Vite 7.0.0 dev server. Production builds work fine. For development, recommend upgrading to Node 20+.

### Immediate Next Steps

#### 1. Setup Supabase Database (Priority: HIGH)
1. **Create Supabase project** at https://supabase.com
2. **Copy your project URL and keys** to the `.env` file
3. **Run the schema:** Copy `supabase-schema.sql` content and run in Supabase SQL editor
4. **Add sample data:** Copy `sample-data.sql` content and run in Supabase SQL editor
5. **Test the website** - should now show sample posts instead of empty state

#### 2. Create Admin User (Priority: HIGH)
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
2. Create a new user with email/password
3. Note the user ID for creating posts

### Database Setup Checklist
1. ✅ SQL schema created (supabase-schema.sql)
2. ❌ Need to run schema in Supabase dashboard
3. ❌ Need to add sample posts
4. ❌ Need to create admin user
5. ❌ Need to test all CRUD operations

### Environment Variables
